# Majestic Connector

With the Majestic Connector for Google Data Studio you can report on the most important statistics from Majestic. When you connect Majestic (you need to have a paid subscription.) to Data Studio, it will bring you some advantages, for example:

- You can combine the data with other sources to get new insights
- All your data sources in one dashboard
- Data awareness within your organisation
- Free and easy to use (thereâ€™s no catch), just like our other connectors
